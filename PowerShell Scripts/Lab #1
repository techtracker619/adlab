## 📜 How to Create and Run These PowerShell Scripts on Windows Server 2019

This guide walks you through creating and executing the AD DS installation and domain promotion scripts manually on your virtual machine.

### 🗂️ Step 1: Create a Scripts Folder

1. Log in to your **Windows Server 2019** VM.
2. Press `Win + E` to open **File Explorer**.
3. Navigate to a working directory like `C:\` or your Desktop.
4. Create a new folder called:

```plaintext
Scripts
```

### 📄 Step 2: Create Script Files

#### 📁 `install_features.ps1`

1. Open **Notepad**.
2. Paste the following code:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services, DNS -IncludeManagementTools
```

3. Click **File > Save As...**:
   - File name: `install_features.ps1`
   - Save as type: `All Files (*.*)`
   - Save location: `C:\Scripts\`

---

#### 📁 `promote_to_dc.ps1`

1. Open a new Notepad window.
2. Paste this code:

```powershell
Import-Module ADDSDeployment

Install-ADDSForest `
    -DomainName "lab.local" `
    -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "YourSecurePassword123!" -AsPlainText -Force) `
    -InstallDNS `
    -Force
```

3. Save as:
   - File name: `promote_to_dc.ps1`
   - Save as type: `All Files (*.*)`
   - Save location: `C:\Scripts\`

> 🔐 **Important:** Replace `"YourSecurePassword123!"` with a strong password. This is used for DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode).

---

### 🛡️ Step 3: Allow PowerShell Script Execution

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** (Start → type `PowerShell` → right-click → **Run as administrator**)
2. Run this one-time command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
```

This allows you to run scripts in the current session without permanent changes.

---

### ▶️ Step 4: Run the Scripts

Navigate to your scripts folder:

```powershell
cd C:\Scripts
```

Then run the installation and promotion scripts one by one:

```powershell
.\install_features.ps1
.\promote_to_dc.ps1
```

> 🖥️ Your server will reboot automatically after the second script when promoted to a domain controller.

---

✅ After reboot, log back in. Your server is now the Domain Controller for `lab.local`.
